# NFC-Controlled Electromagnetic Door Lock (Custom PCB)

The design files for a custom PCB created in Fusion 360 for an **NFC-controlled electromagnetic door lock**.

A **12V power supply** is used to power the eletromagnetic lock, NFC reader, and ATmega328P core. The schematic uses the Arduino Nano as the base and adds the additional functionality. 

## PCB Installation
This is an example of how the PCB can be used in a system.
